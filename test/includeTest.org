* Include files

Include other files during export. For example, to include your .emacs file, you could use:

#+INCLUDE: "./orgmodeTest.org" src emacs-lisp
The first parameter is the file name to include. The optional second parameter specifies the block type: ‘example’, ‘export’ or p‘src’). The option third parameter specifies the source code language to use for formatting the contents. This is relevant to both ‘export’ and ‘src’ block types.

If an include file is specified as having a markup language, Org neither checks for valid syntax nor changes the contents in any way. For ‘example’ and ‘src’ blocks, Org code-escapes the contents before inclusion.

Unsupported:
#+INCLUDE: "~/my-book/chapter2.org" :minlevel 1
#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"   
^^^^^ Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded
